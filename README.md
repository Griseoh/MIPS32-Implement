This project implements a 32-bit MIPS processor using Verilog. It features a modular design that includes key components such as the instruction fetch unit, decode unit, execution unit, memory access unit, and write-back stage. The processor supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set and is designed for educational purposes, demonstrating the architecture and operation of a MIPS-based CPU.
